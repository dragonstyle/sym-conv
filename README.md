# sym-conv

This project contains a [notebook](notebooks/sym-conv.ipynb) that shows my exploration of convolutions with SymPy.

## Install
I recommend installing into a Python virtual environment.

``` sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Dev Setup
``` sh
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

Install pre-commit (see https://pre-commit.com/#install)

From the root of the repo, run `pre-commit install`
